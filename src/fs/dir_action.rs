//! What to do when encountering a directory?

/// The action to take when trying to list a file that turns out to be a
/// directory.
///
/// By default, exa will display the information about files passed in as
/// command-line arguments, with one file per entry. However, if a directory
/// is passed in, exa assumes that the user wants to see its contents, rather
/// than the directory itself.
///
/// This can get annoying sometimes: if a user does `exa ~/Downloads/img-*`
/// to see the details of every file starting with `img-`, any directories
/// that happen to start with the same will be listed after the files at
/// the end in a separate block. By listing directories as files, their
/// directory status will be ignored, and both will be listed side-by-side.
///
/// These two modes have recursive analogues in the “recurse” and “tree”
/// modes. Here, instead of just listing the directories, exa will descend
/// into them and print out their contents. The recurse mode does this by
/// having extra output blocks at the end, while the tree mode will show
/// directories inline, with their contents immediately underneath.
