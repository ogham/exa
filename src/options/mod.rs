//! Parsing command-line strings into exa options.
//!
//! This module imports exa’s configuration types, such as `View` (the details
//! of displaying multiple files) and `DirAction` (what to do when encountering
//! a directory), and implements `deduce` methods on them so they can be
//! configured using command-line options.
//!
//!
//! ## Useless and overridden options
//!
//! Let’s say exa was invoked with just one argument: `exa --inode`. The
//! `--inode` option is used in the details view, where it adds the inode
//! column to the output. But because the details view is *only* activated with
//! the `--long` argument, adding `--inode` without it would not have any
//! effect.
//!
//! For a long time, exa’s philosophy was that the user should be warned
//! whenever they could be mistaken like this. If you tell exa to display the
//! inode, and it *doesn’t* display the inode, isn’t that more annoying than
//! having it throw an error back at you?
//!
//! However, this doesn’t take into account *configuration*. Say a user wants
//! to configure exa so that it lists inodes in the details view, but otherwise
//! functions normally. A common way to do this for command-line programs is to
//! define a shell alias that specifies the details they want to use every
//! time. For the inode column, the alias would be:
//!
//! `alias exa="exa --inode"`
//!
//! Using this alias means that although the inode column will be shown in the
//! details view, you’re now *only* allowed to use the details view, as any
//! other view type will result in an error. Oops!
//!
//! Another example is when an option is specified twice, such as `exa
//! --sort=Name --sort=size`. Did the user change their mind about sorting, and
//! accidentally specify the option twice?
//!
//! Again, exa rejected this case, throwing an error back to the user instead
//! of trying to guess how they want their output sorted. And again, this
//! doesn’t take into account aliases being used to set defaults. A user who
//! wants their files to be sorted case-insensitively may configure their shell
//! with the following:
//!
//! `alias exa="exa --sort=Name"`
//!
//! Just like the earlier example, the user now can’t use any other sort order,
//! because exa refuses to guess which one they meant. It’s *more* annoying to
//! have to go back and edit the command than if there were no error.
//!
//! Fortunately, there’s a heuristic for telling which options came from an
//! alias and which came from the actual command-line: aliased options are
//! nearer the beginning of the options array, and command-line options are
//! nearer the end. This means that after the options have been parsed, exa
//! needs to traverse them *backwards* to find the last-most-specified one.
//!
//! For example, invoking exa with `exa --sort=size` when that alias is present
//! would result in a full command-line of:
//!
//! `exa --sort=Name --sort=size`
//!
//! `--sort=size` should override `--sort=Name` because it’s closer to the end
//! of the arguments array. In fact, because there’s no way to tell where the
//! arguments came from -- it’s just a heuristic -- this will still work even
//! if no aliases are being used!
//!
//! Finally, this isn’t just useful when options could override each other.
//! Creating an alias `exal="exa --long --inode --header"` then invoking `exal
//! --grid --long` shouldn’t complain about `--long` being given twice when
//! it’s clear what the user wants.
